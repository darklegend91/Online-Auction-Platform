            Online auction or eAuction helps in price discovery and help the seller realise the best price for his goods or services.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Auctions are a costly process, and it consumes a lot of time and cost. It is also inconvenient for bidders to be physically present for auction at the designated time and place specially when they know that there can be only one winner and rest everybody would have to return empty handed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Online auction is very cost effective and it saves cost and time for both bidders and for the seller. The whole eAuction process is transparent and competitive which ensures not only correct price discovery but also maximum participation as bidders can join the bidding from anywhere in the world.</p>
